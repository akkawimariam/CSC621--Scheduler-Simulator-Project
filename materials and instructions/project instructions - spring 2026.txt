Project Overview
The objective of this project is to design and implement a transaction scheduler simulator that analyzes database schedules and determines their correctness properties with respect to serializability and recoverability constraints. The project emphasizes a deep understanding of concurrency control theory, transaction correctness, and schedule equivalence as studied in advanced database systems.
Students are free to choose:
•	The programming language
•	The user interface (command-line, GUI, or web-based)
However, the theoretical correctness and rigor of the implementation will be strictly evaluated.

Functional Requirements
1. Schedule Representation
Your system shall accept or generate transaction schedules consisting of a sequence of operations executed by multiple transactions. Each transaction must be well-formed, satisfying the following:
•	Begins with a START(Ti) operation
•	Ends with exactly one of:
o	COMMIT(Ti) or
o	ABORT(Ti)
•	Contains only valid operations between START and COMMIT/ABORT
________________________________________
2. Supported Operations
In addition to standard database operations, the scheduler must support:
•	READ(Ti, X)
•	WRITE(Ti, X)
•	INCREMENT(Ti, X)
•	DECREMENT(Ti, X)
Increment and decrement operations must be treated as write operations with respect to conflict detection and concurrency analysis.

3. Serializability Analysis
The scheduler must determine whether a given schedule is:
•	Conflict-serializable
Notes:
•	Serializability must be evaluated exclusively using conflict equivalence.
•	View equivalence must not be used or assumed.
•	The system should explicitly construct and analyze a precedence (serialization) graph.
•	The output must clearly indicate:
o	Whether the schedule is conflict-serializable
o	If serializable, the equivalent serial order(s), when applicable

4. Recoverability and Correctness Properties
For each schedule, the scheduler must determine whether it satisfies the following properties:
1.	Recoverable Schedule
o	A transaction commits only after all transactions whose data it has read have committed.
2.	Avoids Cascading Aborts (ACA)
o	Transactions read only data written by committed transactions.
3.	Strict Schedule
o	No transaction reads or writes a data item until the transaction that last wrote that item has committed or aborted.
4.	Rigorous Schedule
o	A stronger condition where neither reads nor writes are allowed on a data item until the transaction holding the last read or write lock has committed or aborted.
The system must:
•	Clearly state whether each property is satisfied.
•	Provide a brief explanation or reasoning for each determination.
________________________________________
5. Output Requirements
For any given schedule, the system must output:
•	Whether the schedule is conflict-serializable
•	Whether it is:
o	Recoverable
o	ACA
o	Strict
o	Rigorous
•	The reasoning or conditions that lead to each conclusion
•	Any detected violations (e.g., cycles in the precedence graph, illegal read-before-commit, etc.)
________________________________________
Non-Functional Requirements
•	The implementation must be modular and extensible.
•	Code should be well-documented, with clear separation between:
o	Schedule parsing
o	Conflict analysis
o	Correctness property checks
•	The interface should be intuitive and allow easy testing of multiple schedules.
